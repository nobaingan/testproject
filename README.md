### **Decision Matrix for Dynamic Filtering Approaches in Spring Boot**  

| **Approach**            | **How It Works** | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Best For** |
|-------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|--------------|
| **@JsonFilter (with Interceptor)** | Uses Jackson's `@JsonFilter` along with a Spring Interceptor to dynamically filter response fields based on request parameters. | - Centralized logic via Interceptor. <br>- Supports deep nested filtering. <br>- Decouples filtering from controllers. <br>- Can be applied globally across endpoints. | - Requires careful configuration to avoid unwanted filtering. <br>- Harder to debug as filtering happens after controller execution. <br>- Slight performance overhead. | Best for **global filtering needs** across multiple endpoints with **nested field support**. |
| **ObjectNode (Jackson Tree Model API)** | Manually constructs response JSON using `ObjectNode`, removing or adding fields dynamically. | - Full control over JSON structure. <br>- Can handle deeply nested objects efficiently. <br>- No need for annotations or external dependencies. | - Adds more manual code, increasing complexity. <br>- Can be harder to maintain in large applications. <br>- Less reusable compared to declarative approaches. | Best for **custom response structures** and cases where JSON needs to be transformed significantly before returning. |
| **@JsonView (Jackson Views)** | Uses `@JsonView` to define different field sets and selects the appropriate view at runtime. | - Easy to implement with minimal configuration. <br>- No extra dependencies required. <br>- Good for predefined field sets. | - Does not support dynamic field selection at runtime. <br>- Cannot be used for deeply nested structures dynamically. <br>- Requires pre-defining views in code. | Best when **predefined filtering rules** are sufficient and don’t need runtime customization. |
| **Squiggly Library** | Uses query parameters (`fields=account.name,account.balance`) to filter fields dynamically. | - Simple and easy to integrate. <br>- Supports nested filtering out of the box. <br>- No need for extra custom logic in controllers. | - Adds an external dependency. <br>- Limited community support and updates. <br>- Slight performance impact for large responses. | Best for **quick filtering without custom implementation** when using REST APIs. |
| **GraphQL** | Uses GraphQL queries to fetch only the requested fields dynamically. | - Extremely flexible for nested filtering. <br>- Reduces over-fetching of data. <br>- Well suited for complex APIs. | - Requires switching from REST to GraphQL. <br>- Steeper learning curve. <br>- Additional setup and tooling needed. | Best for **APIs requiring highly flexible field selection** and **complex nested structures**. |

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Use `@JsonFilter` with an Interceptor** if you want a **global** filtering solution for REST APIs.
- **Use ObjectNode** if you need **complete control over JSON** structure.
- **Use `@JsonView`** if you have **predefined field sets** that don’t change dynamically.
- **Use Squiggly Library** for an **easy-to-integrate** solution with REST APIs.
- **Use GraphQL** if you need **highly flexible field selection** and are okay with adopting GraphQL over REST.
